# Krypto

### 🧠 About the Project
Krypto is a full-stack web application designed to track real-time cryptocurrency prices and generate professional PDF reports with statistical visualizations.

This was a collaborative university group project built in an Agile workflow. Our team worked in sprints, used a task board (Trello), held regular meetings, and focused on iterative delivery with quality code reviews and testing.
